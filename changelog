## 2016-07-13 4.0.0

* What a long time it has been
* CircleCI now builds, tests, and generates Haddock
* Haddocks are published to https://hlian.github.io/linklater/hackage/
* No more `Maybe` handling for `slashSimple` (it was useless)

## 2015-07-21 3.2.0

* Slack.com seems to have broken GET incoming hooks, so we're switching to POST
* Support for Stack
* Unconstrained dependencies

## 2015-04-01 3.1.0

* Removed: silly usage of GADTs
* Simpler: incoming hook tokens are now incoming hook URLs
* Corgi picture: made bigger
* Added: Command now carries the name of the command
  * Patch by Ulysses Popple
* Text: stricter!
  * I decided to make the library take strict texts only,
    as they are simpler to reason about and lead to fewer
    conversions: really only WAI vends lazy text
  * Sorry for the churn!
