## 2015-04-01 3.1.0

* Removed: silly usage of GADTs
* Simpler: incoming hook tokens are now incoming hook URLs
* Corgi picture: made bigger
* Added: Command now carries the name of the command
  * Patch by Ulysses Popple
* Text: stricter!
  * I decided to make the library take strict texts only,
    as they are simpler to reason about and lead to fewer
    conversions: really only WAI vends lazy text
  * Sorry for the churn!
